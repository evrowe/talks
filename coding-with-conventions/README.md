## Why?

- Makes code more easily understandable and accessible to teams (any time more than one person is working on anything)
- Makes your code more maintainable (to yourself and to others)
- Can help reduce technical debt
- Improves the *QUALITY* of your code

## What kinds of standards are we talking about here?

- Convention Over Configuration
- Code standards (when to use what, what order to do things)
- Documentation standards
- Code STYLE standards

## Ways we can put these principles to work:

- Use strongly opinionated frameworks (e.g. Ember, Rails)
- Document your standards and include them as part of the onboarding process
- Enforce ALL standards during code reviews
- Require linting and distribute shared linting configs (e.g. .jshintrc)
- Set up and distribute .editorconfig files to help automatically enforce (some) style standards
